    Reggaeton is a genre that originated in Puerto Rico during the late 1990s, blending elements of reggae, dancehall, and 
    Latin music. It is characterized by its rhythmic beat known as the "dembow" and often features lyrics in Spanish. 
    Reggaeton has gained widespread popularity, with artists like Daddy Yankee, Bad Bunny, and J Balvin bringing the genre 
    to international audiences. The music is often associated with urban culture and has influenced mainstream pop and hip hop.
