    Funk is a genre that originated in the mid-1960s, marked by a strong, danceable groove and a focus on rhythm and bass. 
    Funk's roots lie in soul, jazz, and rhythm and blues, with a particular emphasis on syncopated rhythms and improvisation. 
    Pioneers like James Brown, Parliament-Funkadelic, and Sly and the Family Stone helped shape the sound of funk, which has 
    gone on to influence hip hop, rock, and electronic music. Funk is particularly known for its use of "the one," a heavy 
    emphasis on the first beat of every measure.
