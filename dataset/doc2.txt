    Classical music refers to the formal musical tradition rooted in Western culture, dating back to the period of 
    the 11th century. It spans a broad period from the medieval to the present day. This genre is known for its highly 
    structured compositions, often written for orchestras, choirs, or solo instruments such as the piano or violin. 
    Some of the greatest composers of classical music include Ludwig van Beethoven, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and 
    Johann Sebastian Bach. Many classical pieces, like Beethoven’s "Fifth Symphony" or Mozart’s "Requiem," remain 
    central to modern music education and performance.
