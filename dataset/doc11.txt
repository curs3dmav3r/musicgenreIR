    Folk music is a genre that encompasses traditional songs passed down orally through generations, often reflecting the 
    cultures, values, and stories of a particular community or region. Folk music has roots in rural, working-class communities 
    and is typically played on acoustic instruments like the guitar, banjo, or fiddle. Notable folk musicians include Woody 
    Guthrie, Bob Dylan, and Joan Baez. The genre has influenced various other styles, including rock and country, and continues 
    to thrive today in both traditional and modern forms.
