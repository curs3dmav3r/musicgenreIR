    Jazz is a genre of music that originated in the African-American communities of New Orleans in the late 19th 
    and early 20th centuries. It is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms, 
    and improvisation. Jazz has influenced many other genres of music, from rock and roll to hip hop. Famous jazz 
    musicians include Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, and John Coltrane. One of the most remarkable aspects of 
    jazz is its ability to evolve, leading to subgenres such as bebop, smooth jazz, and fusion.
