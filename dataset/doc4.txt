    Hip hop originated in the Bronx, New York City, during the 1970s, primarily among African-American and Latino youth. 
    It includes four main elements: rapping (MCing), DJing, breakdancing, and graffiti art. The genre is notable for 
    its rhythmic vocal style, often performed over sampled beats or synthesized backing tracks. Pioneers of hip hop 
    include artists like Grandmaster Flash, Tupac Shakur, and The Notorious B.I.G. Over time, hip hop has evolved 
    into various subgenres such as trap, conscious rap, and drill, making it one of the most influential music genres 
    in the world.
