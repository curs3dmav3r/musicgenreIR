    Electronic dance music (EDM) refers to a broad range of percussive electronic music genres made primarily for nightclubs, 
    raves, and festivals. EDM's early roots are found in the disco era of the 1970s, but it became its own genre in the late 
    1980s and 1990s, thanks to developments in synthesizers and drum machines. Subgenres include house, techno, trance, and 
    dubstep. Today, prominent DJs like David Guetta, Calvin Harris, and Skrillex have become global sensations, making EDM 
    one of the most popular genres worldwide.
