    Metal is a genre of rock music that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, heavily influenced by blues rock 
    and psychedelic rock. Metal is known for its heavy guitar riffs, powerful drumming, and aggressive vocals. Subgenres 
    such as thrash metal, death metal, and black metal emerged over time, each adding their unique twist to the basic 
    formula. Bands like Metallica, Iron Maiden, and Black Sabbath have played significant roles in popularizing the genre. 
    Lyrically, metal often explores dark and complex themes, resonating with a dedicated and passionate fanbase.
