    Reggae emerged from Jamaica in the 1960s and is closely associated with the Rastafarian movement. Reggae's rhythm 
    is characterized by a strong offbeat, known as the "skank," and it often addresses social and political issues, 
    making it more than just a musical genre. Bob Marley is undoubtedly the most famous reggae artist, and his songs 
    such as "One Love" and "No Woman, No Cry" have become anthems for peace and unity worldwide. Reggae has influenced 
    many other genres, including hip hop, punk, and dub.
