    Rock music emerged in the 1950s and 1960s as a dominant force in popular music. It draws heavily from earlier 
    genres such as blues, country, and rhythm and blues, combining them into a high-energy format driven by guitars, 
    bass, and drums. Bands like The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, and Led Zeppelin pushed the boundaries of the genre, 
    creating lasting cultural impacts. In the late 20th century, rock gave rise to subgenres such as hard rock, 
    punk rock, alternative rock, and grunge, each representing different stylistic innovations.
