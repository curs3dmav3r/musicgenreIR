    Ska is a genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1950s, blending elements of Caribbean mento and calypso with American 
    jazz and rhythm and blues. Ska is characterized by its upbeat tempo, walking basslines, and offbeat rhythms. The genre 
    gave rise to subgenres like rocksteady and reggae. Bands like The Skatalites and The Specials were key players in popularizing 
    ska, which has influenced punk rock and modern reggae music.
