    R&B, or rhythm and blues, is a genre that originated in the 1940s and 1950s, blending elements of jazz, gospel, and 
    blues. Known for its soulful vocals and smooth, groove-driven sound, R&B has evolved over the decades, giving rise 
    to various subgenres, including contemporary R&B. Artists like Ray Charles, Stevie Wonder, and Beyonc√© have all played 
    a significant role in shaping the genre. R&B remains a dominant force in popular music, influencing everything from 
    hip hop to pop.
