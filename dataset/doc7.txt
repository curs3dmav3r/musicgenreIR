    Blues is a genre that originated in the Deep South of the United States around the end of the 19th century, by African 
    Americans from roots in African musical traditions, spirituals, and work songs. The genre is characterized by its use 
    of the blues scale, call-and-response patterns, and specific chord progressions, particularly the 12-bar blues. 
    Blues has deeply influenced other genres, including rock, jazz, and R&B. Key figures in the blues tradition include 
    B.B. King, Muddy Waters, and Robert Johnson, whose work has laid the foundation for countless musicians.
