    Country music has roots in the folk traditions of the Southern United States, particularly in the Appalachian region. 
    Early country music was marked by simple chord progressions, string instruments such as the guitar, banjo, and fiddle, 
    and lyrics often dealing with heartache, rural life, and personal struggles. Legends like Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson, 
    and Dolly Parton are key figures in the development of country music. Modern country has expanded to incorporate 
    elements of pop and rock, broadening its appeal with artists like Taylor Swift and Luke Bryan.
