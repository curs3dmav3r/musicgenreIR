    Soul music emerged in the late 1950s and early 1960s as a combination of gospel, rhythm and blues, and jazz. It is 
    characterized by its passionate vocals, emotional intensity, and strong rhythms. Many soul songs focus on themes of love, 
    heartache, and resilience. Legendary soul artists such as Aretha Franklin, Otis Redding, and Marvin Gaye helped define the 
    genre, which has significantly influenced the development of funk, disco, and modern R&B.
