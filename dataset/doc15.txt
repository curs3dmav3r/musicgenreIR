    Punk rock is a genre that emerged in the mid-1970s, characterized by its fast tempos, raw sound, and anti-establishment 
    lyrics. Punk is often seen as a reaction against the perceived excesses of mainstream rock music. Bands like The Ramones, 
    The Sex Pistols, and The Clash helped define punk, with their simple, aggressive music and DIY ethos. Punk has since 
    splintered into various subgenres, such as hardcore punk and pop-punk, and continues to influence the broader rock landscape.
