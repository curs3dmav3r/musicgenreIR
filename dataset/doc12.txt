    Gospel music is a genre deeply rooted in Christian religious traditions, especially within African-American churches in the 
    United States. It often features powerful vocals, call-and-response singing, and themes of faith, salvation, and hope. 
    Gospel music has had a profound influence on other genres such as soul, R&B, and rock and roll. Some of the most notable 
    gospel artists include Mahalia Jackson, Kirk Franklin, and the Clark Sisters. Gospel continues to be an important genre 
    in both spiritual and mainstream music contexts.
